# Github

We will be looking at the following important features of Github for use within your projects.

## [CODEOWNERS](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-code-owners)

"You can use a CODEOWNERS file to define individuals or teams that are responsible for code in a repository."

## [README / MARKDOWN FILES](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

"Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling all forms of writing on the GitHub platform."

* README.md - This automatically displays when in located directory on Github.
* Other md files will display when you view them.

For a nice overview of what you can do with markdown look at the [markdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet), there is a [emoji cheatsheet](https://github.com/ikatyang/emoji-cheat-sheet/blob/master/README.md) too :sunglasses:.

## [GITHUB PAGES](https://pages.github.com/)

"Websites for you and your projects. Hosted directly from your GitHub repository. Just edit, push, and your changes are live."

## [ISSUES](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/)

"Issues are a great way to keep track of tasks, enhancements, and bugs for your projects. They’re kind of like email—except they can be shared and discussed with the rest of your team. Most software projects have a bug tracker of some kind. GitHub’s tracker is called Issues, and has its own section in every repository."

## [WIKI](https://guides.github.com/features/wikis/#creating-your-wiki)

"Every repository on GitHub comes with a wiki. After you’ve created a repository, you can set up the included wiki through the sidebar navigation. Starting your wiki is simply a matter of clicking the wiki button and creating your first page."

## INSIGHTS

Insights give you a few stastical data regarding your repository, you can view this by clicking the insights button:
