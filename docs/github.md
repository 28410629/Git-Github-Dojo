# Github

We will be looking at the following important features of Github for use within your projects.

## [CODEOWNERS](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-code-owners)

"You can use a CODEOWNERS file to define individuals or teams that are responsible for code in a repository."

## [README / MARKDOWN FILES](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

"Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling all forms of writing on the GitHub platform."

* README.md - This automatically displays when in located directory on Github.
* Other md files will display when you view them.

For a nice overview of what you can do with markdown look at the [markdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet), there is a [emoji cheatsheet](https://github.com/ikatyang/emoji-cheat-sheet/blob/master/README.md) too :sunglasses:.
